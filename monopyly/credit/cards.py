        Query the database to select credit card fields. Cards can be

        Parameters
        ----------

        Find a credit card using uniquely identifying characteristics.

        Queries the database to find a credit card based on the provided
        criteria. Credit cards in the database can almost always be
        uniquely identified given the user's ID and the last four digits
        of the card number. In rare cases where a user has two cards
        with the same last four digits, the issuing bank can be used to
        help determine the card. (It is expected to be exceptionally
        rare that a user has two cards with the same last four digits
        from the same bank.) If multiple cards do match the criteria,
        only the first one found is returned.

        ----------
        bank_name : str, optional
            The bank of the card to find.
        last_four_digits : int, optional
            The last four digits of the card to find.

        Returns
        -------
        card : sqlite3.Row
